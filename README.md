# TwoCanRusokuDriver
OpenCPN twocan plugin driver for Rusoku TouCAN Marine adapter

Unlike the previous driver, this new driver does not rely on the CAN Abstraction Layer (CANAL) driver canal32.dll
that must be copied to the Windows System32 folder.

Installation instruction:

  Copy compiled driver file to: C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\opencpn\plugins\twocan_plugin_pi\data\drivers
